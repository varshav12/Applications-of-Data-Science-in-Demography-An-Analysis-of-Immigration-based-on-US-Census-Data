# Demography-88-Final-Project
Demography 88 is a connector course to Computer Science C8 (CS C8, Foundations of Data Science), exploring the topics of demography and immigration by using tools learned in the CS C8 class.

This project studies the effects of Latino immigration (in the US labor force) on African American wages (from African Americans in the labor force) during 2000 and 2017.

Created and developed by myself in my Demography 88 class in December 2018, as a Capstone project.

Mentor and Professor: Dr. Carl Mason, Department of Demography, UC Berkeley
